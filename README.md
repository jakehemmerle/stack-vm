# VM Translator

This repo contains a translator and second-stage compiler that translates a simple, stack-based VM's bytecode to a two register ISA.

It is heavily based off of the Hack ISA and VM architecture from the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course.

Please excuse the violently unidiomatic Python code. Part of this exercise was to learn the language!
